# NodeGoat

Being lightweight, fast, and scalable, Node.js is becoming a widely adopted platform for developing web applications. This project provides an environment to learn how OWASP Top 10 security risks apply to web applications developed using Node.js and how to effectively address them.

## Getting Started

OWASP Top 10 for Node.js web applications:

### Know it!
1. Please update the below gitpod link, and replace '...' with your forked git repo 
2. Click [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/...) to deploy
3. Once the application is running, you can access the tutorial page at */tutorial* and follow the guide
 
This application bundled a tutorial page that explains the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and how to fix them.

### Do it!

A Vulnerable Node.js App for Ninjas to exploit, toast, and fix. You may like to set up your own copy of the app to fix and test vulnerabilities. Hint: Look for comments in the source code.

##### Default user accounts

The database comes pre-populated with these user accounts created as part of the seed data -
* Admin Account - u:`admin` p:`Admin_123`
* User Accounts (u:`user1` p:`User1_123`), (u:`user2` p:`User2_123`)
* New users can also be added using the sign-up page.
